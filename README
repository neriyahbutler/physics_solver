This code that I created solves physics problems in either Physics 1 or Physics 2. 
The choice of equations are limited to what are within the respected subject's text file.

The purpose of this project was to use all (well most rather) of the things I'd learned in my intro to Computer Science course in Python.


#PLANNED UPDATES!!
At the moment, I do not have a lot of equations within the text files, but I will add more in the future
Additionally, I plan on making the code able to solve for unknown variables within an equation
